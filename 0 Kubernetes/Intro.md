# Learn Kubernetes the right way

## Introduction

I want to learn kubernetes the right way. 
I have been using kubernetes for a while now, a few years to be exact.
I'm the only developer and I also the only one the do the DevOps work.
Our kubernetes cluster is a bare metal cluster, version 1.18, I know it's quite old. :)

## Tooling

- Intall rancher-desktop from [here](https://rancherdesktop.io/)
- Install kubectl and k9s from homebrew
- If all is ok you should be able to run `kubectl get nodes` and see the nodes in your cluster

## What Kubernetes is

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that helps you manage your containers in a cluster.

A better definition in my opinion is the following:

Kubernetes is the operating system of the cloud. Kubernetes is a bunch of "virtual machines" who are able
to communicate with each other in a proper way, and to divide their workloads.
